Predicting house prices with catboost algorithm
In this project we are using different types of algorithms.

1)XGBOOST

2)LGBOOST

3)CatBoost

4)Random Forest

STEPS:

1)Importing the dataset from kaggle 

2)Preprocess the data

3)label encoding

4)train/test split

5)feature extraction
  
  5.1)Light Gradient Boosting (LGBMRegressor)
  
  5.2)Random Forest (RandomForestRegressor)
  
  5.3)Cat Boost (CatBoostRegressor)
  
  5.4)Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBRegressor)

6)prediction

7)evaluation

RESULT:

The catboost is better than other three algorithms by predicting better results with high Accuracy.
