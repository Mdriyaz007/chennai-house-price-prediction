Predicting house prices with catboost algorithm
In this project we are using different types of algorithms.
1)XGBOOST
2)LGBOOST
3)CatBoost
4)Random Forest

STEPS:
1)Importing the dataset from kaggle 
2)Preprocess the data
3)label encoding
4)train/test split
5)feature extraction
  5.1)Light Gradient Boosting (LGBMRegressor)
  5.2)Random Forest (RandomForestRegressor)
  5.3)Cat Boost (CatBoostRegressor)
  5.4)Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBRegressor)
6)prediction
7)evaluation

RESULT:

The catboost is better than other three algorithms by predicting better results with high Accuracy.

Ranking by Accuracy

    Algorithms                    Accuracy
1)CatBoostRegressor                 99.3%

2)LGBMRegressor                     98.6%

3)RandomForestRegressor             97.1%

4)XGBRegressor                      96.6%
  
  results may differ based on number of Dataset.
